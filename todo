Sad Path
----
- Failures:
    - Token request
    - Initial Configuration request
    - Authorization Configuration request failure
    - History
        - Activity fetch failure
- Session Expired, stop polling.
- Redirect To login should clear token cache.

Maybe:
----
- Redux Persist
    - Make sure that tokens are secure
- Initial Loading Screen

Needs UX:
    - Offline Mode
    - Login


Tech Debt:
-----
- Less storing objective id when object still lives in objective document.
