- What happens on logout?

-PWA
    - Cache index html expiry (for dem sweet updates)
    - Notify user backend is not working.

- Enable manual sync of data?

- Multi-Device Usage (Dafuq happens and who is in charge?)

Sad Path
----
- Failures:
    - Token request
    - Initial Configuration request
    - Authorization Configuration request failure

Maybe:
- Redux Persist
    - Make sure that tokens are secure
- Initial Loading Screen

Needs UX:
    - Offline Mode
    - Login
