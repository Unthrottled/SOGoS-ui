Immediate things need to be done:
----
- Getting a new access token user experience.

Mile-Stones after MVP:
-----
- Shared pomodoro count.
- Sharable dashboard.
    - auto-sync
- On-boarding Experience
- Strategic
    - Knowing the right balance of load an recovery.

Edge Cases
----
- When offline and creating tasks, the task disappears on refresh.
- You cache by guid, but the activities are just by id
    - That means that other people can see your objectives
- What happens when you are doing timed intervals and you close the app?
- What happens on logout when doing a timed activity?
- No internet.
- Resuming timed load after not using the app.
- Failure

Things To Test For Real:
---
- Enable manual sync of data.
    - Periodic cache sync.


Things to think about
-----
-PWA
    - App does not work without wifi.
    - Check to see when internet comes back.
    - Tactical Settings storage
        - offline mode
    - Cache index html expiry (for dem sweet updates)
    - Notify user backend is not working.
    - Post application installation.
    - Data Storage.

Maybe:
----
- Redux Persist
    - Make sure that tokens are secure
- Initial Loading Screen
- Cross Device Settings Sync.
- Better 404 handling

----


Think pad:
-----

- Multi-Device Usage (Dafuq happens and who is in charge?)
