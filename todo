Things To Test For Real:
---
- Enable manual sync of data.
    - Periodic cache sync.

Immediate things need to be done:
----

-PWA
    - App does not work without wifi.
    - Check to see when internet comes back.
    - Tactical Settings storage
        - offline mode
    - Cache index html expiry (for dem sweet updates)
    - Notify user backend is not working.
    - Post application installation.
    - Data Storage.

- History:
    - Limit history to range.
    - Update History when viewed?

- Objectives:
    - Update Objectives when viewed?
    - bulk upload only if has stuff
    - What do when offline and has not looked at objectives?

- Really long activities freak the UI out.

Other Stuff
-----

Needs UX:
    - Offline Mode
    - Login

Sad Path
----
- Failures:
    - Token request
    - Initial Configuration request
    - Authorization Configuration request failure
    - History
        - Activity fetch failure

Maybe:
----
- Redux Persist
    - Make sure that tokens are secure
- Initial Loading Screen
- Cross Device Settings Sync.
- Better 404 handling

----


Think pad:
-----

- What happens when you are doing timed intervals and you close the app?

- What happens on logout?

- Multi-Device Usage (Dafuq happens and who is in charge?)



Tech Debt:
-----
- Less chatty actions (BIG REFACTOR)
