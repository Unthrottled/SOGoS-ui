Immediate things need to be done:
----
Migration Steps:
- [X] Add New Hash Identifiers to prod
- [ ] Deploy New API along side old API
  - [ ] Test TacMod against new API
- [ ] Release New SOGoS UI
  - [ ] Update initial.json to have v2 prefix
- [ ] Fix Mobile app to be deployable to chrome store.
- [ ] Scale down old api after a week.

- loses current activity when refreshing

Mile-Stones after MVP:
-----
- Add TacMod Plug on Activity Start
- Sharable dashboard.
    - auto-sync
- On-boarding Experience
- Strategic
    - Knowing the right balance of load an recovery.

Edge Cases
----
- When offline and creating tasks, the task disappears on refresh.
- You cache by guid, but the activities are just by id
    - That means that other people can see your objectives
- What happens on logout when doing a timed activity?

Things to think about
-----
-PWA
    - App does not work without wifi.
    - Check to see when internet comes back.
    - Tactical Settings storage
        - offline mode
    - Cache index html expiry (for dem sweet updates)
    - Notify user backend is not working.
    - Post application installation.
    - Data Storage.

Maybe:
----
- Initial Loading Screen
- Better 404 handling

Think pad:
-----

- Multi-Device Usage (Dafuq happens and who is in charge?)
