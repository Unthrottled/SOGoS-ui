- Offline mode
    - If not logged in

- Initial Loading Screen

- When refresh token is expired prompt to login again (no automatic request please).
    - Do not refresh on polling.

- Multi-Device Usage (Dafuq happens and who is in charge?)

- What happens on logout?

- Redux Persist
    - Make sure that tokens are secure

- Enable manual sync of data?

- Refresh token not working 100%

Sad Path
----
- Failures:
    - Token request
    - Initial Configuration request
    - Authorization Configuration request failure


Needs UX:
    - Offline Mode
    - Login
